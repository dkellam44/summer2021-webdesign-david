    The HTML and CSS Workshop has a slightly different approach to teaching beginners the core concepts of HTML and CSS.
    It prioritizes "learning by doing" by emphasing its step-by-step exercises and projects. 
    Clear introductions and extensive technical details are included, but users are given the option to skim through the theory and jump right into the exercises.
    I intend to reffer to this book for practice as I learn the basics.

The JavaScript Workshop is from the same series, but with the focus on the JavaScript language. 
It has the same flexible structure for beginners that supports going straight to the exercises and diving deeper into the details as needed.
This looks like a valuable companion resource for when I begin learning JavaScript.
