Partnership Dance is a fun active, creative and connective activity I've been lucky enough to experience. Sometimes it's referred to as social dancing, ballroom dance, or by individual dance names like tango, salsa, swing, ect.  Typically partnership dance is where two people move and improvise together within a range of common patterns, conventions, and genres of music. Some familiar types of partner dance are tango, salsa, waltz, and swing. 

When I was in college in search of a job, friend of mine owned a small partnership dance studio and offered to take me in and show me the ropes. It didn't take long before I got swept into the fun and energy of the dance world. I was lucky enough to teach hundreds of students over 3 years and even participate in a few competitions. Argentine Tango eventually became my favorite dance. It's a soulful and elegant dance that is very easy to learn and very difficult to master.


But if you are brand new and want to enjoy dancing, your ambition doesn't have to be (and probably shouldn't) be winning a competition. No matter who you are, dance can be a wonderful means of expression, fitness and social cohesion. And while there is a tradition of some of these dance cultures to  be ridged and perhaps carry a legacy of appropriation and exclusion, much of the social dance scene is evolving into a much more flexible, inclusive and dynamic place. 

And the good news is you don't have to be particularly coordinated or especially gifted to dance. If you ever notice yourself enjoying a piece of music and find yourself snapping your fingers or tapping your feet, then dance is for you. And there are many different paths to get started so I recommend you find the one that is perfect fit for you.
